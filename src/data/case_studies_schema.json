SFist, https://sfist.com/2024/02/09/man-who-rampaged-naked-shooting-gun-in/\nSummary: Veterans face conditions that make approaching psychedelic work difficult, such as high rates of PTSD and suicidality, the concurrent challenge of forming a new civilian identity once out of the service, and coming from a culture that is not very emotionally available and historically removed from psychedelic-friendly circles. Taking psychedelics in an unsupported context and alongside psychiatric medication can heighten risk of complications. This may have been the case with a combat veteran who experienced a psychotic break in San Francisco in early 2024.\nCase Study: A combat veteran who had served in Afghanistan experienced a psychotic break after consuming psilocybin mushrooms on New Year's Eve. Reportedly, he \"had received a double dose of an unspecified medication he takes for PTSD two days earlier\". Armed and naked, the man fired multiple rounds into vehicles and a home in San Francisco’s Richmond District. His wife testified that he became delusional, threatened her and their baby, and demanded she strip, believing they were in the Garden of Eden. He also threatened his landlord and allegedly tried to lure him outside by shooting at his car. Police intervened before anyone was harmed.\nHis attorney described him as a decorated veteran struggling with PTSD. A judge ordered him into a veterans’ rehabilitation program rather than pre-trial detention, citing his clean record and the circumstances of his breakdown.",

Retrieved from https://www.fda.gov/media/180703/download\nCase Study: ​A woman alleges she was sexually abused during an MDMA-assisted psychotherapy clinical trial in British Columbia. In 2015, she participated in a Phase II clinical trial for MDMA-AT for complex post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) under the guidance of a husband and wife team of therapists. During sessions, what the trial subject described as inappropriate physical contact occurred, including instances where she was pinned down and spooned. Subsequently, the participant moved in with the couple and entered a sexual relationship with the husband. In 2018, she filed a civil lawsuit against him alleging repeated sexual assault; the case was settled out of court. Upon learning of these ethical violations, the organization that sponsored the trial severed ties with the therapists, reported the incident to health authorities, and implemented a new code of ethics explicitly prohibiting sexual contact between therapists and participants. This incident has raised significant concerns about the potential for abuse in psychedelic therapy settings and underscores the necessity for stringent ethical standards and oversight.\n“Now I Only Buy From Trusted Sources” Expecting MDMA, an experience turns unsettling\nSubject identity details: 21-year-old man\nSetting: Dance Club\nYear: 2013\nSubstance/Dose – Primary: Unknown (misrepresented as MDMA), 250 mg\nConfidence level of identification: Low\nSubstance(s)/Dose(s) – Secondary: Alcohol, dose unspecified\nCase Study Source: Erowid Center\nSummary: A 21-year-old man experienced an intense state of dread, anxiety and dissociation after consuming 250mg of powder purported to be MDMA. Negative effects persisted into the next day. The author now only buys from trusted sources or waits for others to test material first.\nCase Study: An experience report author reports a harrowing experience with what was supposed to be MDMA but turned out to be an adulterated or misrepresented substance. The person had prior experience with MDMA and expected the usual effects of euphoria and stimulation, but instead endured an intensely distressing and dissociative state.\nThe author recounts the events leading up to the experience, beginning with purchasing the substance from an unverified source and consuming 200mg initially, followed by an additional 50mg when the expected effects did not materialize. Initially, there was mild stimulation and euphoria, but soon, the experience turned deeply unsettling. The usual pleasurable effects of MDMA were absent, replaced by a sense of profound dread, disconnection from reality, and slowed perception reminiscent of ketamine, but without the pleasurable dissociation. As the night progressed, the author felt increasingly detached, trapped in an overwhelming sense of anxiety and despair. Attempts to engage socially, including dancing and conversing with friends, failed; he felt devoid of joy or desire despite the vibrant club environment. Eventually, realizing something was seriously wrong, they left the club early and struggled through a night of mental torment, repetitive thoughts, and auditory disturbances while attempting to sleep. The psychological distress continued into the morning, with the author still feeling the lingering effects well into the next day. Despite finally coming down by the evening, the experience left a lasting impression, reinforcing the dangers of consuming untested substances. The author concludes with a strong warning about the risks of street MDMA, urging others to use reagent testing kits or at least verify the substance's quality through trusted sources before consumption. Ultimately, the experience serves as a cautionary tale about the unpredictability and dangers of misrepresented drugs, emphasizing that anyone can fall victim to a “bad batch” if they do not take precautions.",

He was not on any medication that his family was aware of, although he did have multiple preexisting medical conditions. The decedent began having a difficult trip at two hours after ingestion. At three and a half hours after ingestion he began having what appeared to be seizures but could have been strokes or a heart attack, or a combination of those. 911 was called. He died approximately four hours after ingestion. The decedent’s brother and the brother’s girlfriend were also present and also ingested the same material. The brother experienced “intense gastrointestinal disturbances” and was still experiencing effects at 30 hours after ingestion. He and his girlfriend both reported extremely strong experiences and were taken to the hospital in restraints after paramedics/police arrived. At least two other serious adverse events on another continent were reported in connection with the misidentified material, which was sold online. Its identification as Bromo-dragonfly was confirmed by laboratory analysis conducted by Energy Control (Spain) and Drug Detection Laboratories (California) on behalf of Erowid Center. Suggestibility in Retreat Settings Ethics codes and complaints procedures for retreats\nSetting: Psychedelic Retreat Centers\nCase Study Source: Challenging Psychedelic Experiences Project\nSummary: An ayahuasca retreat center uses aggressive marketing tactics to maximize profits. A facilitator feels a strong attraction to a client at a psychedelic retreat and initiates a relationship with the client, which lasts for months. Are clients in suggestible states susceptible to exploitation, and what can be done to mitigate risk?\nCase Study: An ayahuasca retreat center uses aggressive marketing tactics to maximize profits. Its online marketing promises that the vast majority of customers experience “miraculous breakthroughs”. During its week-long retreats, it seeks to upsell customers to expensive stem cell injections and even offers them the opportunity to buy condos nearby. The retreat center, like many, videos participants on the final day of their retreat giving glowing testimonials, and also encourages them to leave five-star reviews in the days after the retreat.\nWhen clients are under the influence of psychedelic drugs they can be more suggestible to cues from their environment, including from facilitators and staff at retreat centers. This suggestibility can last for 48 hours after a ceremony. Should there be ethical guidelines to protect consumers from being exploited while under the influence? To take another example from another ayahuasca retreat: a facilitator feels a strong attraction to a client at a psychedelic retreat and starts to pay them a lot of attention. In the days after the retreat he begins a relationship with the client, which lasts for some months. Then the client decides this was an inappropriate relationship and reports the facilitator to the retreat owner. The owner says they have a “two strikes and you’re out” rule – if a facilitator starts one relationship with a client they get a warning, if they start two relationships they are fired. The facilitator is still working at the retreat center. Very few psychedelic retreat centers have ethics codes or complaints procedures to protect consumers. Some retreat centers or underground ceremonies don’t even have websites. How could standards be improved in the retreat industry or the underground?",

The unexpected intensity caused panic, severe teeth grinding, and prolonged effects lasting 24 hours. Their hosts provided trip-sitting support. Despite explicit consent being affirmed before engaging in intimate activities, the individual acknowledged the risks of drug-facilitated decisions. They later experienced a delayed serotonin crash and hypomania.\nCase Study: A 30-year-old individual traveled to visit their partner and their partner’s partner (metamour) and decided to bring the remainder of their MDMA in a discreet manner. They crushed 300 mg of MDMA, measured with a precision scale, and concealed it within a capsule placed in a bottle with 5-HTP. The plan was for each individual to consume approximately 100 mg at some point during the visit, followed by a 5-HTP supplement 24 hours later to mitigate any potential crash.\nHowever, the individual did not separate the MDMA capsule from the 5-HTP after arrival, believing they would recognize the difference. They later reflected on their overconfidence in being able to differentiate the capsules, especially under conditions of low lighting, fatigue, or stress. On the night of the incident, they and their hosts consumed a small amount of low-THC cannabis and engaged in a necessary but emotionally challenging discussion. The individual reported that their typical MDMA dose was 100 mg, as higher doses in the past had led to distressing physical reactions, including convulsions. However, that night, they unintentionally ingested the 300 mg MDMA capsule along with their usual medications, which included quetiapine, lamotrigine and 5-HTP for bipolar disorder, anxiety, and insomnia. The effects set in rapidly, and within moments, they reported dizziness and lay down. When the sensations intensified, they experienced an overwhelming sense of alarm, initially fearing an unexplained medical emergency. As the effects continued to escalate, they struggled to comprehend what was happening, feeling a mix of familiarity and terror. Their partner confirmed that the MDMA capsule was missing from the 5-HTP bottle, verifying that they had mistakenly taken it. Despite the unexpected nature of the situation, their hosts remained calm and prepared to support them through an intense night of trip-sitting. Physically, the individual exhibited teeth chattering and shaking, and they bit their tongue excessively in an effort to avoid grinding their teeth. To mitigate this, they improvised a pacifier. Though they later took 800 mg of magnesium, it had little effect at that stage. The remainder of the night was spent in their metamour’s bedroom, as it offered the most space. As the peak effects settled in, the person experienced heightened emotional connectivity. Although the finer details became hazy, they recalled feeling deeply connected to the other two people and requesting to cuddle, which later evolved into intimate interactions with their metamour for the first time. Their partner observed and encouraged the experience. Recognizing the individual’s altered state, their hosts prioritized explicit consent, verifying that the desires expressed under the influence were pre-existing. They acknowledged past MDMA experiences where they had been around people they would not have engaged with while sober, reinforcing the need for caution. Ultimately, all parties felt comfortable proceeding. After approximately five hours, the hosts fell asleep, while the individual remained awake with eyes closed, still feeling the lingering effects. By morning, they continued to experience a mild rolling sensation, fully coming down around the 24-hour mark. They reflected on the fortunate timing of the event, recognizing that on a different night, the experience could have been highly distressing. Additionally, they acknowledged the potential complications of accidentally consuming MDMA alongside 5-HTP. The aftermath included a significant “serotonin crash”, though it was delayed by two days due to an intervening LSD trip. Initially feeling well, they proceeded with the trip without considering the strain on their neurochemistry. The LSD experience itself was not overwhelming but induced sadness regarding unrelated personal matters. The following day, they experienced intense distress, followed by three days of hypomania. Ten days post-incident, they reported feeling back to their baseline level of well-being. “That’s Part of the Medicine Perfecting You” Prolonged adverse effects from re",

His wife detected behavioral changes, prompting him to reduce use to weekends. He acknowledged psychological dependence and questioned the validity of his experiences. While avoiding overt psychosis, prolonged dissociation raised concerns about reintegration into reality. His case underscores the need for awareness of ketamine’s long-term cognitive effects, balancing its therapeutic potential against risks of dependency and altered perception.\nCase Study: A 42-year-old male with extensive experience using various psychoactive substances developed a habitual ketamine (“K”) use pattern over 18 months. Initially, his use was limited to infrequent high-dose intramuscular (IM) sessions (75-100 mg) that elicited profound experiences. Over time, he introduced lower-dose IM administration (20-30 mg per dose, spaced hourly) as part of his evening routine, likening it to a ritual that enhanced focus and relaxation. Despite near-daily use, he reported no significant withdrawal symptoms or physical dependence when abstaining for brief periods.\nThe man described his professional life and personal relationships as stable, maintaining a corporate job and a marriage, despite his secretive use. However, his wife, perceiving behavioral changes under the influence of ketamine, disapproved of its effects and was ultimately able to detect even subtle signs of use. This led to a confrontation regarding his escalating consumption. As a compromise, he agreed to limit usage to weekends but expressed internal conflict over maintaining control over his intake. While he recognized his psychological dependence, he found no immediate compelling reason to discontinue use aside from concerns about long-term health effects. His ketamine sessions often took place in a controlled home environment, accompanied by electronic music and visual stimuli. He described the effect of ketamine as a \"consciousness filter\" that reduced sensory input while enhancing cognitive clarity. He noted that at low doses, he could maintain full functionality, with an increased ability to process financial and philosophical concepts. Recurrent motifs in the man’s experiences included: * A perceived breakdown and reorganization of reality, where all external stimuli could be rearranged into novel, meaningful associations. * A sensation of transcending conventional reality, encountering a universal \"meta-reality machine.\" * A crisis state where he believed he was approaching the dissolution of self, sometimes interpreted as physical death. * Moments of perceived omniscience, where he felt connected to a vast informational network. * A struggle to reintegrate into baseline reality, often requiring cognitive reconstruction to dismiss anomalous perceptions as hallucinations. Following prolonged ketamine use, the man began questioning the sustainability of his habit. While he did not report overt psychotic symptoms outside of acute intoxication, he acknowledged a psychological dependence, describing ketamine as a fundamental tool for structuring his perception of reality. Despite this, he recognized the need to moderate his use, largely in response to interpersonal strain with his spouse and concerns about long-term cognitive effects. He also expressed uncertainty regarding the legitimacy of his experiences, questioning whether they provided genuine insights or were merely elaborate constructions of the mind. While he remained deeply engaged in philosophical contemplation about consciousness and reality, he also acknowledged the potential risks of persistent dissociation and the blurring of boundaries between subjective experience and objective existence. This case highlights the complexities of chronic ketamine use. While ketamine is recognized for its dissociative and psychedelic effects, prolonged use at both low and high doses may contribute to shifts in perception, existential re-evaluation, and potential difficulties with reintegration into baseline reality. Although the man maintained social and occupational functioning, the psychological impact of long-term dissociation and altered cognition warrants further investigation. His case underscores the need for greater awareness of the nuanced effects of ketamine, particularly among users engaging in frequent self-administration outside of clinical settings. Additional",

The San Luis Obispo County Coroner’s Office ruled the death to be caused directly by the low level of LSD detected in her blood. Medical experts who have studied LSD criticized the finding, saying that the low level of LSD found in her blood could not have killed her and those involved in the investigation must have failed to identify substances that were more likely to have caused her death.\nThe Coroner’s Report states that a “Complete Drug Screen” was performed on blood samples and vitreous fluid, but it is not clear what this entailed beyond the assays for LSD, “bath salts”, GHB, “Psilocin (metabolite of Psilocybin) and Synthetic Cannabinoids (‘Spice’)”, U-47700, Buprenorphine, Ethyl Alcohol and Lidocaine that are specifically mentioned. Apparently the coroner did not order tests for any NBOMes, which have been misrepresented as LSD and caused dozens of deaths in the last decade. As of August 2017, no NBOMes appeared on the Drug List available in the Coroner & Medical Examiner section of the testing facility that performed the toxicological analysis. Further, in September 2017 it was reported that the medical examiner responsible for declaring the death to be from “acute LSD poisoning” was removed from his position at the Coroner’s office due to both private conduct (a DUI) and his controversial reports in two deaths, those of Andrew Holland and of Baylee Gatlin.",

The following details were gleaned from a redacted incident report submitted in December 2024.\nAfter masturbating, taking off his shirt and asking the service worker if he “wanted to some of this” (as if preparing to fight, not have sex), the client banged his head against the front door “a couple of times”, punched it, threw punches at the service worker and grabbed the shirt, sweater and necklace of the facilitator. He would not let go and ripped it open. He also ripped blinds from one window, and pulled down the microwave and refrigerator. The client had a cut on his forehead from hitting his head against the door’s peephole, and the facilitator wasn’t sure if he would continue to hurt himself or others. Prior to contacting emergency services, the facilitator and service worker made attempts at redirecting the client to his intention, and changed the music to [be] even more quiet and calm.

Choosing a high-dose experience, he initially enjoyed the effects but soon became agitated and paranoid. Feeling unsafe, the client tried to leave the center, and when staff intervened, he became confrontational. De-escalation efforts failed, necessitating emergency intervention. During an EMS assessment, the client struck a responder, prompting police intervention. After calming down, he opted to stay at the center until the effects subsided. The EMS worker later pressed battery charges, and the client is now awaiting trial.\nCase Study: Note: This case study, while informed by real stories, is hypothetical and intended for discussion purposes only.\nCase Study: Physical Aggression and Facilitator Safety\nA 55-year-old man sought psilocybin therapy through Oregon’s state-regulated program for substance use issues with alcohol. The client had struggled with substances most of his life and had experienced physical and emotional abuse as a child. He committed to and was able to do the preparation session sober, and maintained sobriety for 24 hours before his session without entering withdrawal. He decided on an initial 30mg dose with a 20mg booster due to some previous experience with psychedelics, and wanting to have a “big experience” to get him on the “right path.” One hour after consuming the 30mg, the client was not feeling anything and consumed an additional 20mg dose. Very shortly after, he began feeling the substance. The first 20 minutes, he enjoyed the experience, but then his anxiety grew as the psilocybin took effect, and he began to accuse the facilitator of controlling him. His behavior became erratic, and he grew increasingly distressed, citing his discomfort with the facilitator’s presence and the session environment. As his agitation increased, the client tried to leave the session, expressing that he didn’t feel safe. The facilitator remained calm, reminding him of the guidelines and reassuring him that he was in a secure space. However, the client’s distress continued to intensify, and he began to raise his voice and demand to be left alone. When the facilitator attempted to redirect him, he became physically confrontational, knocking items off of shelves, and approaching the facilitator while yelling a",

While past psilocybin therapy had been effective, this session proved challenging. During intense trauma processing, the facilitator provided little guidance beyond urging the client to “trust the medicine,” leaving them feeling unsupported. Seeking reassurance, they turned to friends outside the session, via phone. Post-session, the facilitator failed to provide integration support due to a personal emergency, and the service center did not reach out to the client, leaving them to feel abandoned. They ultimately sought therapy independently, feeling that the lack of structured follow-up underscored gaps in facilitator training and accountability.\nCase Study: Note: This case study, while informed by real stories, is hypothetical and intended for discussion purposes only.\nCase Study: Generational Trauma and Facilitator Training\nA 28-year-old client from Canada sought psilocybin therapy to address lifelong struggles with depression, anxiety, emotional numbness, and an underlying sense of dread that they could never fully explain. Despite years of traditional talk therapy and medication, they continued to experience deep-seated fears and relationship difficulties. The individual had experience with psilocybin therapy in the past, and it was very effective. The individual’s family had a history of surviving extreme hardship, loss, and displacement due to historical trauma. Though family members rarely spoke about their experiences in detail, they grew up in an environment shaped by inherited trauma. The household was marked by isolation, hypervigilance, emotional suppression, and an unspoken fear of loss and instability. These dynamics deeply affected their sense of safety, emotional expression, and ability to trust others. After extensive research and consultation, the individual participated in a therapeutic psilocybin session in a controlled setting with a trained facilitator in Oregon. The facilitator they selected had stated they had a “trauma informed approach” but did not hold any other healthcare licenses. During the experience, the client reported accessing memories and emotions that had previously felt inaccessible, gaining insight into the fears and survival mechanisms that had shaped their family’s history. However, during the highest moments of intensity around trauma response, the client reported that the facilitator present was not equipped to deal with the situation. The facilitator remained largely inactive, providing minimal reassurance or intervention, continuously telling the client to “trust the medicine” and “surrender.” The participant, feeling acutely unsafe, resorted to seeking support from two friends outside the session via phone. While the psilocybin experience did bring them to the depths of emotional processing they had hoped for, it also revealed serious limitations in the training of this facilitator. This lack of adequate facilitator intervention contributed to feelings of isolation and insecurity during critical moments. Following the session, the individual reported mixed results. There was a lingering feeling of isolation compounded by the fact that the facilitator did not follow program rules in reaching out to the client to offer an integration session due to a “personal emergency.” No one from the service center reached out, and the client felt incredibly alone. The client ended up finding their own therapist and support through their family and friend network, without any direction from the facilitator.",

Initially, she experienced profound inner transformation. After nine months of weekly trips, she took a break to integrate. Six months later, a high-dose mushroom trip plunged her into a nightmarish struggle with what she perceived as a parasitic demon. She spent 18 months struggling alone before seeking peer support from a spiritual awakening group and sharing circle. In the midst of her struggle with the demon, she had a 300 microgram LSD trip, which led her to abandon her former life and join a Buddhist monastery.\nCase Study: -Chloe was a 37-year-old dominatrix from London with complex PTSD stemming from a challenging childhood. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Chloe turned to psychedelics, specifically LSD, as a means of self-healing. She embarked on weekly 100-microgram trips, utilizing Pete Walker's re-parenting techniques to address her trauma. This process led to significant personal growth, including feelings of rebirth and a newfound sense of spirituality.\nAfter nine months of consistent psychedelic sessions, Chloe decided to pause and integrate her experiences. Six months later, she consumed a substantial dose of magic mushrooms, which led to a distressing encounter with a perceived parasitic entity. She described this entity as a purple blob with tentacles, each representing various distractions like alcohol and social media. Chloe felt that this demon fed off individuals' traumas, laying eggs that perpetuated harm. This confrontation left her feeling deeply shaken and led to ongoing efforts to purge the entity from her being. Such encounters with entities – perceived as benign or malevolent - are not uncommon during psychedelic experiences, and have been documented in various cultural and historical contexts. Rick Strassman, during his DMT research in the 1990s, noted frequent reports of contact with beings, some of which were perceived as malevolent. These experiences raise questions about the nature of such entities and their origins, whether they are manifestations of the psyche or encounters with external forces. Internal Family Systems (IFS interprets these entities as sometimes being parts of the self that have become extreme due to trauma, but also sometimes ‘unattached burdens’ – external malevolent entities which need to be ‘exorcised’.  Some clients report this process to be helpful if they believe they have ‘unattached burdens’ within them. However, other clients report finding it disturbing if their therapist tells them they have an entity within them that needs to be removed. A majority of psychedelic guides say they believe in entities, benign or malevolent, and think people can be brought into contact with them during psychedelics. Most psychedelic guides also feel they do not have sufficient training to deal with entities.  Within traditional shamanic ceremonial healing settings, shamans from various traditions may also subscribe to the view that entities are real and can be malevolent and need to be carefully addressed by qualified shamans.",

Despite glowing online reviews for the psychedelic retreat center hosting the training, she endured a harrowing experience. From the start, Julia encountered unethical practices, coercion, and psychological abuse. The lead facilitator administered large doses of psychedelics daily and subjected her to non-consensual treatments. Over the course of a week, she descended into terror, paranoia, and suicidal thoughts. She fled the retreat early with the friend to had accompanied her. Back in the UK, she faced months of physical and emotional recovery.\nCase Study (adapted from Doubleblind article): Julia is a British psychotherapist in her 40s who has been exploring and working with psychedelics for eight years. In 2022, she read glowing reviews about a psychedelic retreat center in Mexico called Sowilo. She and her friend, who’s a psychotherapist, signed up for a 17-day Bufo facilitator training course for $5,000. Sowilo was based at a beautiful farmhouse outside Merida, in Yucatán, Mexico. It was run by a Frenchman named Bruno Cluzel, who calls himself Gabriel, and his wife Aymeline. They lived there with their three children. They offered Bufo (5-MeO-DMT) ceremonies that cost a few hundred dollars and multi-week facilitator training for thousands of dollars. Some people found healing from addictions and other issues, ultimately choosing to stay at the retreat and become employees or followers. But Julia and her friend had bad vibes from the start. When they arrived, Gabriel was mid-ceremony. He eyed them strangely and muttered what sounded like incantations, then produced startlingly accurate information about them. “It was weird,” said Julia. “There were all these red flags, yet for some reason, we stayed.” Sowilo began each day with what Gabriel said was a “low dose” of 5-MeO-DMT, which was not small by any normal metric. Then there would be an even higher dose in the afternoon, or sometimes a magic mushroom or Syrian Rue ceremony. Julia noticed Gabriel was smoking a lot of Bufo, causing him sometimes to fall over. Guests fell over, too, burning themselves with the pipe or banging their heads on the ground. The facilitators offered kambo and Bufo on the same days. One time, Gabriel forcefully grabbed Julia’s head and, without consent, put drops of sananga (eye drops made from a shrub found in Latin America that often elicits a burning sensation) into her eyes. Gabriel was an odd mixture of a guru with Messianic pretensions and a former Miami real estate salesman with slicked-back hair who often spoke about money and how successful he’d been in his previous job. He told Julia he was a “walk-in spirit” called Gabriel (which is his middle name), and sometimes that he was Lucifer. From the first Bufo session, Julia felt in a state of permanent terror. “Every time I almost fell asleep, I felt myself fall into hell,” she said. “Lost souls energetically around me lining up to be released through me, back to the light. At different times during the night, my body jolted as a malevolent spirit entered my body… Gabriel’s remedy was to serve me more Bufo to release them. I felt in a drugged state the whole time. My energy field was blasted open, and I didn’t know what was real or not anymore. I lost myself and I lost my mind.” One day they were served Samadhi, or Syrian Rue, seeds. Julia could hear Gabriel whispering to his assistant, “Make sure she drinks it all. Gabriel lay next to her during the ceremony and said, “You’re so boring, you’re such a victim.” He also tried to get her friend to mock her for being pathetic. She felt like Gabriel was trying to break her spirit. “I experienced an overwhelming, all-consuming paranoia of wanting to kill myself,” she said. “I had this tiny bit of rational mind that was still there, which was able to say, ‘Please, can you move these pipes because if you don’t, I’m going to slash my wrist.’ In the garden, a hammock rope was hanging from a tree. I walked to it, compelled to put a loop in it and wrap it around my neck. Thankfully, someone came so I wasn’t left alone.” Finally, Julia and her friend mustered up the courage to leave the retreat center 10 days early, get to Merida, and find a way back home to the UK. “I spent six weeks physically recovering after returning home with chronic diarrhea and nausea,” she said. “Mentally, I had no e",

The trial results omitted long-term adverse effects, raising concerns about research transparency.\nCase Study: Heather is one of two participants in Braxia’s psilocybin trial for treatment-resistant depression who reported that they encountered prolonged challenges following their involvement. They attributed these difficulties to the conditions of the trial and felt that their experiences were inadequately represented in the published results. The individuals eventually connected with each other and shared their stories.\nThe trial aimed to assess the efficacy of psilocybin in treating depression unresponsive to conventional therapies. While some participants reported positive outcomes, these two individuals experienced adverse effects that persisted beyond the trial’s conclusion. They believed that certain aspects of the trial’s design and implementation contributed to their prolonged difficulties. Both participants felt that the trial conditions did not adequately prepare them for the intensity of the psychedelic experience. They reported a lack of sufficient psychological support during and after the sessions, which they believed exacerbated their challenges. Additionally, they expressed concerns about the integration process, feeling that it was insufficient to help them process and make sense of their experiences. Upon reviewing the published results of the trial, the individuals noticed that their adverse experiences were not thoroughly documented. They felt that this omission presented an incomplete picture of the trial’s outcomes and potentially misled others about the risks involved. This lack of comprehensive reporting prompted them to share their stories publicly. Through sharing their experiences, the participants highlighted the importance of comprehensive support systems in psychedelic research. They advocated for more thorough preparation, monitoring, and integration processes to ensure participant safety and well-being. Their stories serve as a cautionary tale for future trials, emphasizing the need for transparency and the inclusion of all participant experiences in reported outcomes. The experiences of these two individuals underscore the complexities involved in psychedelic research for mental health treatments. Their accounts call for a reevaluation of current protocols to better address the potential risks and ensure that all participant experiences are accurately represented. By doing so, future research can be more ethically sound and provide a clearer understanding of both the benefits and challenges associated with psychedelic therapies. How can trial participants and, eventually, patients receiving psychedelic medicine, be properly prepared for psychedelic treatments, informed about the range of possible outcomes, and best supported during and after sessions?",

Client was referred to an underground facilitator through an online referral network, local to their region, who could provide MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy. The client was specifically seeking treatment to heal the strained relationship with their mother and to process shame and guilt around religious upbringing. The facilitator was a long-practicing medicine facilitator, who was of similar age to the client’s mother.\nFrom the onset of the therapeutic relationship, the facilitator failed to maintain professional boundaries. The facilitator engaged in inappropriate conversations around personal life and romantic life, spoke of other clients she’s worked with and facilitated sessions from her home, requiring all clients to stay overnight in her private residence. The client participated in three MDMA sessions and one Psilocybin session over the course of four months, with frequent but sporadic contact through phone calls and text messages. The morning after the first MDMA session, the facilitator engaged in conversations that involved her personal and professional goals to open up a healing center. Client was in a highly suggestible state and enamored with the idea. Client wanted to support his facilitator in any way possible and offered to help and be involved. The conversations continued to evolve throughout the treatment time and the facilitator began inviting the client, who was seeking community and integration support, to psychedelic gatherings at her home and began getting involved socially and meeting other clients that she was working with. In the subsequent months, the facilitator hosted multiple community ceremonies with small groups and the client participated in four medicine groups in four months. Client was struggling to fully integrate back into work/life and was attending more psychedelic events and beginning to experiment in the psychedelic recreational space with other substances. Client was enamored with the psychedelic community and began developing friendships and romantic partnerships, with aspirations to go into psychedelics professionally and with the on-going encouragement of his facilitator. The client reported feeling extremely attached to the facilitator and was willing to do anything she encouraged them to do. Several months later, the client experienced several grief events (mother passed away and romantic breakup), became dysregulated, and reported to their facilitator that they were in crisis.  The facilitator became aggressive and accusatory towards the client, claiming that they were to blame for their own misfortune.

PMID: 33934465.\nSummary: NT, a 21-year-old woman, was hospitalized after experiencing her first manic episode, which she believes was triggered by psilocybin use. Despite a family history of bipolar disorder, she had never experienced mania before. Her mental health history includes anxiety, depression, and PTSD, with treatment involving SSRIs, rTMS, and ketamine. After her psilocybin experience, she developed paranoia, racing thoughts, and severe distress, leading to involuntary hospitalization. Diagnosed with bipolar disorder, she was stabilized on lithium and aripiprazole before transitioning to lamotrigine. Since then, she had one brief mixed episode but has not experienced further psychotic symptoms.\nCase Report (Edited for length): NT is a 21-year-old female identifying woman who came to the office of her outpatient psychiatric provider a month after a hospitalization for a brief psychotic episode, later diagnosed as mania, that she believes was triggered by consuming a substantial amount of Psilocybe cubensis mushrooms that she had taken recreationally. While she has a positive family history (father and paternal grandmother) of bipolar disorder, she herself had never had a manic episode or been diagnosed with bipolar disorder before this hospitalization. She notes that over the past 4 years she had been diagnosed with and treated for anxiety that had later developed into depression and PTSD following rape. Psychotherapy and SSRI medications were beneficial but did not lead to remission. Eight months prior to her manic episode, she was hospitalized for depression and suicidal ideation. She was placed on fluoxetine in the hospital and released after her acute symptoms resolved about a week later. A few weeks following the hospitalization and still on her fluoxetine, she sought treatment with rTMS (standard 6 weeks, 5 treatments per week) for treatment-resistant depression. At the facility that provided rTMS, she also received adjunctive ketamine infusion (6 infusions over 2 weeks offered at initiation of her rTMS treatment) to help with depressive symptoms. The ketamine did produce short-lived (e.g., hours to days) antidepressant benefit, but the rTMS resulted in remission of her depression. Following completion of her course of rTMS, the SSRI was discontinued. NT had never previously consumed psilocybin and reports the psilocybin experience was pleasant and mystical. Drug effects resolved about 5 hours after ingestion, and she describes having had a positive “after-glow” effect for a 1–2 hours following the end of acute drug effects. About 36 hours after ingestion of the psilocybin, NT’s thoughts began racing. She noted an irritable mood and was observed to have pressured speech. She was confrontational with family and required only 2–3 hours of sleep each night. These symptoms persisted for 4 days and then, in addition to her original symptoms, she also began to feel fearful of being sexualized by others. She stopped eating. After 3 more days of these symptoms, her boyfriend and family became concerned about her welfare and called the police. NT was placed on an involuntary psychiatric hold for 48 hours. She notes that at the time she felt she had special powers that allowed her to read and respond to other people's energies, and that she could communicate with people through telepathy. She became fearful that her boyfriend and family were intending to harm her, and tried to run away, but was sedated and restrained with haloperidol and olanzapine. She remembers akathisia following the administration of these antipsychotics, and she remembers calling out “Kill me, kill me, kill me” several times. The inpatient psychiatric team diagnosed NT with a bipolar disorder because she met DSM-V criteria in both duration and symptoms for a manic episode (that was most likely psilocybin induced). She was admitted to an inpatient behavioral health unit and stabilized on lithium and aripiprazole. After 1 week she was transferred to a partial hospitalization program, and then to outpatient care. Because of adverse effects, we reduced and stopped lithium and aripiprazole and started lamotrigine monotherapy. She has not had any further psychotic symptoms; however, she has had one ",

After engaging a self-proclaimed practitioner through an online directory, the client underwent an unregulated ceremony involving psilocybin and purported MDMA. Severe dysregulation led to police intervention, excessive restraint, and hospitalization for substance-induced excited delirium. Blood tests revealed methamphetamine, and the client faced felony charges. The facilitator evaded responsibility, and despite reporting, remains listed online. This case underscores critical gaps in psychedelic therapy regulation, practitioner accountability, and the risks of unregulated underground ceremonies.\nCase Study:  Legal & Physical Trauma in an Underground Psychedelic Ceremony\nA retired law enforcement officer of 22.5 years service, was seeking alternative treatments to help relieve her PTSD symptoms that developed throughout her career. Without finding effective treatment or relief from her on-going symptoms and reading countless articles about the potential of psychedelics, her curiosity around psychedelics began a deep search of finding a safe and reliable psychedelic practitioner to help her find relief and heal her PTSD.  She had never taken any psychoactive substances prior to this. She used a well-known online directory of “vetted providers” and selected a provider who had a Master’s Degree in Psychology, who works as a coach and claimed to have “more than 10 years of experience working with individuals and couples.”  The practitioner presented herself as a trusted, trained psychedelic provider through her website, social media & provider referral list. The practitioner travels to various locations throughout the US and Mexico and utilizes vacation rentals & AirBnB’s as ceremony spaces.  A couple of days prior to the session, the practitioner informed the client that they had to change locations and that there would be one additional participant along with a helper in attendance. The client trusted the practitioner's guidance and expertise At the start of the ceremony, the participant was given 2 grams of dried psilocybin mushrooms in a steeped tea, along with a capsule of what the client was told was pure MDMA, intended as a \"heart-opener.\"  During the ceremony, the client was given at least 3 more grams of dried psilocybin mushroom, in capsule form. Several hours into the ceremony, the client became severely dysregulated and physically violent, which was later attributed to the intense effects of the substances. Unaware of her actions and in an uncontrolled altered state, she damaged the property rental and broke several items in the home. The facilitator lacked the proper experience and training to manage such a situation and called law enforcement for assistance.  When the police arrived, they found the participant naked, bleeding, and unable to respond to basic commands.  First responders utilized excessive force to sedate and restrain her, deploying bean bag rounds, causing the client extreme physical injuries, bruising, and pain. She was transported to a hospital trauma unit, where she was hospitalized for substance-induced excited delirium.  At the hospital, laboratory tests of her blood were positive for methamphetamine.  During the interaction with law enforcement, the facilitator blamed the client for the incident and filed a police report against her. The facilitator blocked the client, shut down her social media and left the country.  She did not offer any follow up support or refunds for services rendered.  The client reported the incident to the online directory from which she found the facilitator, but the provider is still active on their site. The client was charged with felony vandalism and was re-diagnosed with PTSD after the incident.  The client spent months in court, attempting to save her pension and avoid criminal charges. Nine months after the ceremony, the client was granted admittance into the mental health diversion program with the court system and must follow the court's orders, including on-going therapy, as part of the program for at least one year. After that time, at the court's discretion, the case may be closed with no plea entered. Training Programs and their Role as “Gatekeepers” When a psychedelic facil",

She felt reassured by the sitters’ guidance.\nThe session took place in a structured setting with bedrolls, eyeshades, and music. During the session, the client initially experienced mild anxiety but maintained a sense of security. However, around 4-5 hours in, she entered a difficult state, losing all reference points and experiencing intense disorientation. Panic escalated, culminating in a moment where she attempted to run from the room. The sitters intervened, gently restraining her and providing reassurance. The lead sitter encouraged her to return inward, stating, “There’s nothing out here, go back inside.” Throughout the peak, the client repeatedly called out for familiar figures, seeking grounding. The sitters maintained a steady presence, offering her reminders to breathe and validating the experience. The other client in the room, witnessing her distress, moved closer but was reminded that they, too, had their own journey. The client vacillated between feelings of detachment and existential insight. She worried that she might not return to her familiar identity. As the session waned, and into the next day, she still was not grounded, couldn’t drive, and could barely talk. After the trip, integration was arduous, involving support from the lead sitter through multiple phone over many months. This experience underscores the critical role of attuned, experienced sitters in holding space for a client’s extreme psychological state, including through her attempt to flee the session on foot.",

Staff allowed the client to speak to their emergency contact on a staff person’s mobile phone. The client decided to leave the service center out the back door. Service center staff all attempted to de-escalate the situation and talk the client in to returning to the center. Client refused, and would step into the road if staff got within a few feet of them, but stepped back on the sidewalk when staff backed up. Due to the danger of the high-traffic road, 911 was called. Police dispatcher advised that as long as the client stayed out of the road, there was nothing they could do, and asked that the service center call them back if client stepped back into the road. Staff continued to keep client within sight, but stayed at a distance, so as not to spook them into stepping into the road. Client’s transportation showed up and client got in the car with them. Client refused to return to the center and refused to return the center staff person’s phone. Client’s emergency contact agreed to take them home and keep them safe until acute effects wore off.

The Journal for Nurse Practitioners, 19(2), 104484. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nurpra.2022.10.013\nSummary: Although rare among users of MDMA, hyponatremia is one of the most common causes of MDMA-related deaths or serious injuries. This case describes a non-fatal case of MDMA-related hyponatremia in a 45-year-old man.\nCase Study (adapted from published case report): A 45-year-old man with a history of heavy substance use presented to primary care with fluctuating blood pressure and cognitive disturbances following a high-dose MDMA session. He had long been a regular MDMA user and recently made a significant dietary change—eliminating his usual 5-10 liters of Diet Coke daily and replacing it with an equivalent amount of water. This shift, combined with MDMA's antidiuretic effects, led to acute hyponatremia. MDMA promotes antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion, impairing the body's ability to excrete excess water. Simultaneously, the patient’s high Diet Coke consumption had previously provided a substantial sodium intake (800-1600 mg/day), which was suddenly lost when he switched to water. The combination of water retention from MDMA and reduced sodium intake resulted in an electrolyte imbalance, likely exacerbating his symptoms of confusion, altered speech, and anxiety. The patient’s condition improved with fluid restriction and electrolyte replacement, and he was managed as an outpatient. His case highlights the dangers of excessive water intake in MDMA users, especially those accustomed to high-sodium beverages. This case underscores the need for harm reduction strategies regarding hydration and MDMA use, particularly in non-clinical psychedelic settings.

They had hopes of experiencing greater insight, intense joy, euphoria, and heightened sensory perception. The person struggled with treatment-resistant depression and had been seeing a therapist for the majority of the past 10 years with little helpful result. The individual repeatedly commented on how expensive the psilocybin care was and decided to take a 35mg dose, aiming for a deep experience. Contrary to their expectations and hopes, the session proved to be one of the most difficult and painful experiences they had ever endured. Instead of joy or insight, they were overwhelmed by intense nausea, discomfort, and a rapid heartbeat. They spent most of the session on the floor of the bathroom, crying and struggling to find relief. Rather than the anticipated mystical or transcendental moments, the experience was dark and distressing. In the aftermath, the individual was left with lingering physical discomfort, including a persistent headache and an unsettled stomach. They expressed concerns about the dosage, wondering if they had taken too much and whether a lower dose (such as 20mg) might have provided a more manageable and meaningful journey. Two days after the experience, the individual continued to process what had happened in an integration session. They questioned whether they had done something wrong and whether such reactions were documented in clinical studies. Their facilitator reassured them that plant medicine often brings what is needed for healing, and that breaking down can be part of the process. However, the individual remained uncertain, feeling as though they had missed out on the positive aspects of psilocybin therapy due to the intensity of the session. Hearing others express their positive feelings about the experience only left the person feeling isolated, and like something was “wrong with them.” They expressed a desire to connect with others who have navigated similar negative experiences and sought guidance on whether their reaction was normal. They reached out to their long-term therapist, but the therapist stated that they weren’t familiar with psychedelics and the individual felt the conversation was not productive. The facilitator provided the client with names of individual providers/therapists with knowledge on psychedelics. Despite the challenges, the client still believed in the healing potential of psilocybin but wished for more clarity on what had transpired and how to integrate the experience. An additional integration session was scheduled for the following week, with the hope that further reflection and discussion would provide insight and meaning. The individual remained open to sharing their story after more time had passed but emphasized the need for facilitators to provide clearer guidance on appropriate dosing, particularly for first-time participants. They also spoke about the significant financial burden of the session and the role finances played in wanting to make sure they were able to “go deep,” driving their higher dosing decision.",

The real decline began after he returned home, marking the start of a long-term deterioration. In the immediate aftermath, the author felt mentally disconnected at work, unable to focus. He soon developed fever, fatigue, and a red mark on his neck, which he initially dismissed as an allergic reaction. At one point he smoked a light joint given to him by another participant. That night, the ayahuasca revelations returned in an intrusive and overwhelming way. He suffered from night sweats and extreme anxiety, waking every 30 minutes in distress. Over the next several days, the symptoms worsened, including persistent sleep disturbances (waking drenched in sweat, unable to rest), vibrating/tingling sensations in his face, severe difficulty concentrating, and overwhelming emotional sensitivity Seeking medical help, he visited a doctor who ordered tests but found nothing conclusive. The doctor, unfamiliar with ayahuasca, prescribed tranquilizers, which didn’t help. As his mental state worsened, he experienced intense fear of death and derealization, making him feel as though he were under a spell or curse. Desperate, he reached out to the original ceremony organizer for help. Instead of support, he was told to either return for another session (which required another payment) or “just do some yoga.” When he persisted, the organizer dismissed his suffering, saying, “We’ve done thousands of ceremonies, and everyone’s fine—this is your fault.” He later learned that other participants had also reported severe negative experiences, some even filing complaints against the facilitators. Unable to find relief through conventional medicine, he turned to alternative healing methods, including Reiki, daily prayer (despite not being religious), and a drumming ceremony led by a shaman. Despite these interventions, the man's sensitivity to other people’s emotions intensified, making public transportation unbearable. The concept of time became distorted, with days feeling impossibly long. He quit his job, as he was unable to function. Fortunately, his employers were understanding and agreed to formally terminate the contract so he could receive financial support. Two years after the initial experience, he started working again, albeit in a different field with reduced hours. While he never fully understood what had happened, he speculated that he had experienced a violent Kundalini awakening. Five years later, the man was grateful to have regained his stability but insists that, given the chance to redo it all, he would never have taken ayahuasca. The psychological and emotional toll was simply too great.",

The veteran described his psychedelic experience as positive, inducing feelings of gratitude for life and providing significant relief from his PTSD symptoms.\nDespite these initial therapeutic benefits, the veteran reported that his anxiety symptoms were beginning to resurface. When offered space to discuss his psychedelic journey or current anxiety, the veteran was reluctant to engage deeply with these topics. Instead, he shifted the conversation toward his consideration of returning to war zones as a military contractor in Europe. The support volunteer attempted to explore this significant life decision with the veteran and tried multiple times to redirect the conversation back to his psychedelic integration needs and anxiety symptoms. Throughout the exchange, the veteran remained reserved in his communication. The conversation included brief sharing about military experiences between the veteran and the volunteer. Before concluding the conversation, the veteran was deeply pondering whether they would choose \"military contract work or freedom\". The interaction highlights the complex interplay between therapeutic psychedelic use, PTSD, identity tied to military service, and the challenges of integration when underlying psychological needs remain unaddressed.",

After the client has a difficult experience, they report him to his licensing board. He faces losing his license or worse.\nCase Study: Luca had benefited from having had positive, therapeutic experiences with psychedelics and MDMA. Interested in helping others to experience similar healing, he studied to become a licensed marriage and family counselor, in the hopes of eventually working with these materials legally with clients. He chose this career specifically because it appeared that FDA approvals would come, and regulatory changes would pave the way for legal access to psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy.\nLuca established his practice, working in compliance with his license. As a side gig, separate from his licensed practice, he sat for a separate set of clients, holding space for their psychedelic experiences. At one point, a regular client in his licensed practice, learning of his secret role as an underground psychedelic sitter, requested such a session. Against his better judgment, due to complex circumstances, Luca sat for this client, whose first experience was very positive and uplifting. The client assertively requested a second session, and again, Luca reluctantly complied. The second session was harrowing. The client was so upset, they reported Luca to his licensing board.

Despite the persistence in popularity of McKenna’s writings and talks, this significant event has been largely absent from mainstream narratives about his life and work.\nCase Study: Terence McKenna, a prominent advocate for psychedelic substances during the 1980s and 1990s, is renowned for his extensive discussions on the benefits and transformative potential of psychedelics. However, less known is an intense personal experience he had in the late 1980s that profoundly affected his perspective on these substances.​\nDuring this period, McKenna underwent a particularly challenging mushroom trip that left him deeply unsettled. The specifics of this experience are not widely documented, but it is noted that the ordeal was severe enough to cause McKenna to reassess his previously unreserved endorsement of psychedelics. This incident introduced a more cautious tone in his subsequent discussions, acknowledging that such substances could lead to unpredictable and potentially distressing experiences.​ Despite this significant event, accounts of McKenna's difficult trip have been largely absent from mainstream narratives about his life and work. This omission raises questions about the selective portrayal of influential figures in the psychedelic community and the potential consequences of not fully acknowledging the risks associated with psychedelic use.​ McKenna's experience serves as a reminder of the complex and unpredictable nature of psychedelics.",
