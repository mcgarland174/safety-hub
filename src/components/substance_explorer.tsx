Each additional dose is metabolized more slowly, causing dramatic accumulation. This is compounded by MDMA\'s memory impairment effects, which can lead users to forget how much they\'ve taken. Redosing is one of the most dangerous MDMA practices and dramatically increases risk of all adverse events including hyperthermia, hyponatremia, and serotonin syndrome.',

But don\'t let the brevity fool youâthose minutes contain what users describe as the most intense psychedelic experience possible. The onset is measured in seconds. Peak effects at 2 minutes.
